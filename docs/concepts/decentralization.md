# Decentralization

A decentralized network grows organically. It can span the entire planet while focusing on local activities. But more important than size is the number and quality of internal connections.

Since there is no central point of attack, it cannot be corrupted, manipulated or shut down.

Our infrastructure, such as energy supply, food production, and communications networks, has also been highly centralized in the past. In the 21st century, we finally have all the knowledge and technology to organize these things in a decentralized way.
